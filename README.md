# Data-Analysis-Sales-Dashboard
A fully interactive sales dashboard featuring multi-city insights, performance metrics, and visually rich charts for quick decision-making.

his repository contains an Excel-based Sales Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel (2016). The dashboard provides:

- Region selector (city tabs/buttons)
- Multiple dashboard views (Dashboard 1..4)
- Tables of sales executives and KPIs (Total Sales, Target Hit %, Away From Target %)
- Charts: horizontal bar chart, pie chart, and line chart for KPIs
- Filters and slicers to interactively view data
- Conditional formatting and small visual badges showing values

The solution is intended as a reporting/proof-of-concept dashboard (not a full BI application). It is ideal for demonstrating Excel dashboard design, charting, and basic interactivity.
